			<p id="phistory">The Downtown Diner first opened its doors in November of 1972!  Bit and Byte Smith
			   were new to Techieville and discovered an empty building on the corner of 5th and
			   Hypertext Avenue.  They always dreamed of opening up their own restaurant.  That 
			   dream came true<br> in the Fall of 1972 when they purchased the building and began<br> 
			   construction on the Downtown Diner.  In November of 1972, they<br> were ready to open
			   their doors.  They decided to have a grand opening on Thanksgiving Day and offered
			   a free turkey dinner to all who<br> attended.  This became a tradition that is still
			   being followed to this<br> day.  Every Thanksgiving Day, the Downtown Diner opens its
			   doors and serves a free turkey dinner.</p>

			   <p id="phistory2">In 1994, Bit and Byte decided it was time to retire.  They turned over the reigns
			   of the Diner to their son, Chip.  Chip continues to manage the Diner today with the
			   help of his wife, Drive.  Chip and Drive<br> have added a few of their own special 
			   recipes to the menu.  But for the most part, the menu hasn't changed too much from 
			   the original one.<br>  The Downtown Diner went through a major remodel in 2002. A<br>
			   private party room was added which can handle groups up to 40 people. If you would
			   like to plan a private party at the Downtown<br> Diner, please contact Chip or Drive at
			   the restaurant.</p>
