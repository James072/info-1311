<h2 id="histtitle">History</h2>
			<p id="phistory">The Downtown Diner first opened its doors in November of 1972!  Bit and Byte Smith
			   were new to Techieville and discovered an empty building on the corner of 5th and
			   Hypertext Avenue.  They always dreamed of opening up their own restaurant.  That 
			   dream came true in the Fall of 1972 when they purchased the building<br> and began 
			   construction on the Downtown Diner.  In November of<br> 1972, they were ready to open
			   their doors.  They decided to have a grand opening on Thanksgiving Day and offered
			   a free turkey dinner to all who attended.  This became a tradition that is still
			   being followed to this day.  Every Thanksgiving Day, the<br> Downtown Diner opens its
			   doors and serves a free turkey dinner.</p>
			   	   
			<p id="phistory2">In 1994, Bit and Byte decided it was time to retire.  They turned over the reigns
			   of the Diner to their son, Chip.  Chip continues to manage the Diner today with the
			   help of his wife, Drive.  Chip<br> and Drive have added a few of their own special 
			   recipes to the menu (which can be found on our "Specials" page).  But for the most part, the menu 
			   hasn't changed too much from the original<br> one.  The Downtown Diner went through a major remodel in<br> 
			   2002. A private party room was added which can handle groups<br> up to 40 people. If you would like 
			   to plan a private party at the Downtown Diner, please contact Chip or Drive at the restaurant.</p>
